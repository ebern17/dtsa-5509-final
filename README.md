# dtsa-5509-final

This repository houses the jupyter notebook I created and data necessary to run the code. The dataset contains features related to two rice species, Osmancik and Cammeo, and has features that were created by processing images of grains of rice and calculating the different values. My goal was to create a strong model to classify the samples and to determine the best features to use.

DTSA_5509_Final.ipynb contains the code for the analysis and modeling
